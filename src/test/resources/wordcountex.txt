so really we don’t know anything about stars, except that their life is terrible and senseless,
since all their movements through space are predetermined and subject to the laws of mechanics,
which leave no hope for any chance encounters. But then, I thought, even though we human beings
always seem to be meeting each other, and laughing, and slapping each other on the shoulder, and
saying goodbye, there’s still a certain special dimension into which our consciousness sometimes
takes a frightened leap, a dimension in which we also hang quite motionless in a void where there’s
no up or down, no yesterday or tomorrow, no hope of drawing closer to each other or even exercising
our will and changing our fate; we judge what happens to others from the deceptive twinkling of
light that reaches us, and we spend all our lives journeying towards what we call light, although
its source may have ceased to exist long ago.”
